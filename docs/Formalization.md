## Profiling a Program
Profiling a program with respect to a given taxonomy consists of assigning exactly one category from the taxonomy to each instruction in the program.\\
Let:

\\( p = \langle i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n \rangle \\) be a program, represented as a finite sequence of instructions extracted from a notebook,

 \\(  \mathcal{T}  \\) be a taxonomy, i.e., a finite set of categories \\( \{t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_t, \texttt{undefined}\} \\),

 \\( \text{Instr}(p) = \{ i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n \} \\) be the set of instructions in program \\( p \\).
